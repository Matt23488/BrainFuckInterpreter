# BrainFuckInterpreter
A rough draft of an interpreter library for BrainFuck written in C#. Also includes a simple console debugger.
The code is pretty rough, hence it being called a rough draft. I have future plans to add a GUI project to the solution for the
purpose of having a fully-featured BrainFuck IDE complete with visual debugger. Who knows if I'll ever get that far.
